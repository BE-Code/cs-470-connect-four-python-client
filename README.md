# cs-470-reversi-python-client

A new Python 3 client for the BYU CS 470 Reversi lab. All that you need to change for your project is the `make_move` function in the reversi_bot.py script. See comment there for information on useful functionality. I'll try to add more documentation and things when I get around to it. 

To run, enter directory where this code is located and type `python reversi_python_client.py localhost 1` if you want this running on localhost and for it to be first player. You can do 2 for second player or specify a different host as well.

**UPDATE 9/25:** I just found a fairly serious bug and am currently fixing it. It should be all fixed by the end of today, but if you're using this client make sure to update to the new code on 9/26. Thanks.
