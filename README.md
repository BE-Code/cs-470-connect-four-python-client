# cs-470-reversi-python-client
A new Python 3 client for the BYU CS 240 Reversi lab. All that you need to change for your project is the `make_move` function in the reversi_bot.py script. See comment there for information on useful functionality. I'll try to add more documentation and things when I get around to it. PULL REQUESTS ARE WELCOME.
